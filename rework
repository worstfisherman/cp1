echo "Enter an equation of degree 1"; #OK
node computor.js "5 * X ^ 0 = 4 * X ^ 0 + 7 * X ^ 1"; #OK

# 8) Equations in natural form. 
echo "Enter an equation in natural form. Management of natural input output"; #Wrong!
node computor.js "5 + 4 * X + X^2= X^2"

# Good after, if the program
# Resoud, put the points anyway and make a little hiss
# admiration, but in any case, the program should not crash.

# Есть ли Bonus?

# Management of the input in natural form

# The program is able to handle an entry in natural form?
# - Only one coefficient ("4") is considered to be in factor of X ^ 0.
# - Only one X is considered as coefficient 1 and power 1.
# - An absent power ("4 * X") is considered to be worth 1.
# - An absent coefficient ("X ^ 6") is considered to be worth 1.
# - The powers can be in an arbitrary order, possibly repeated.


# Management of errors on the input (lexicon and syntax).

# Display results as an irreducible fraction when it's relevant.
 
# Show intermediate steps.

# Etc ...
